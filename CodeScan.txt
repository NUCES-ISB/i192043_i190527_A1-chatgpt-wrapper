A CodeQL scan was performed on a Python project. The scan included five security-related queries: 
1. "Bad HTML filtering regexp"
2. "Clear-text logging of sensitive information" 
3. "Clear-text storage of sensitive information" 
4. "Binding a socket to all network interfaces" 
6. "Information exposure through an exception". 

Note: Results were found for each query and saved in separate files.
